I always wanted to do a sketchnote for the Commencement Speech **This Is Water** to Kenyon College class of 2005 by the late **David Foster Wallace**. It was always one of my favourite philosophical speeches about the freedom of choice.

The sketchnote is based on the short film by _The Glossary_, who made a fantastic piece of art out of his speech.

The water is habits, the unthinking choices and invisible decisions that surround us every day â€“ and which, just by looking at them, become visible again.
