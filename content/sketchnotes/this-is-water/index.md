I always wanted to do a Sketchnote for the Commencement Speech **This Is Water** to Kenyon College class of 2005 by the late **David Foster Wallace**. It was always one of my favorite philosophical speeches about freedom of choice.

The Sketchnote is based on the short film by _The Glossary_, who made a fantastic piece of art out of his speech.

The water is habits, the unthinking choices and invisible decisions that surround us every day â€“ and which, just by looking at them, become visible again.
