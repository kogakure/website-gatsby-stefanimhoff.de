description: Host domains separately from the web hosting package. Why this is a good idea and what are the benefits?

Many domain owners in Germany still do not know that they do not have to buy their domains together with the storage space. I explain why inclusive domains are a sham and what are the benefits of separating domain and webspace.

Usually one buys a web hosting package from any provider, which then usually includes inclusive domains.

For many smaller domain owners, this may at first glance look like a bargain, but appearances are usually deceptive. Because with these _dirt cheap_ offers are minimum contract terms of **1-2 years** connected. Especially on the Internet, the offers change but almost weekly.

In most cases, domains that you can buy beyond its inclusive domains are too expensive. Prices range from _low_ € 0.99 to € 4.00 per month.

## The Costs in Webhosting

It is just the domains that make no or only a minimal cost factor in hosting.

It is precisely these domains that make little or no cost in hosting. The real cost of hosting is disk space, memory and bandwidth used. Thus, all limitations and _package features_ are completely fictitious and limited only for better advertising.

Whether I use one, two or a hundred databases is technically speaking, no difference, and it also doesn’t matter whether I am offered this or that programming language.

But this is much more profitable for the web hosters: If the customer wants something more because the demands are growing, he usually has to switch to the next higher package. There are web hosts who charge 4.99 €/month for a second database (100MB).

## Switching to a New Webhoster

However, it is particularly painful to notice that hosting domains at the web host is not such a good idea if you want to change.

You get usually confronted with an unsuspecting flood of technical terms, faxes and forms, from time to time, hosters reject the so-called _ChProv_ first, so that another must be started.

The hoster 1&1 has prepared a wonderful top performance of the chicane for its customers: One must cancel his domains in the customer centre and prepare for the _ChProv_. Then you get a phone number, which you have to call. The telephone counsellor, on the other hand, is probably encouraged to dissuade the termination when possible. Then he manually unlocks the necessary forms, which must be signed and faxed to the hoster. And that, even though you had to identify yourself before by private questions doubtlessly.

## Host Externally

Host your domains externally. Web hosts are offering this service (google for _Domainhosting_ or _DomainRobot_).

- This costs in most cases no basic fee.
- You can buy as many domains for friends, relatives or customers as you like.
- Manage your _Handles_ yourself and are thus Admin-C, Tech-C and Zone-C.
- The price is dirt cheap: A .de domain is available from about 0.30 € / month.
- You never have to send any faxes again: ChProv, new orders, terminations of domains - all in one click in the browser.

The best thing, however, is that the move of a domain by simply changing the DNS server is completed within a few minutes.

**But beware:** You need your IP address, or the host must internally give the possibility to forward external requests to the right web hosting package.

Meanwhile, hosters such as 1&1 allow externally hosted domains, too.

This is easier to move away, but with tying contracts over two years this is irrelevant.

## Look at Offers Abroad

There are many good hosters in other countries whose support and service are often ahead of the competition by light-years.

Monthly contracts, abundant traffic and storage space, state-of-the-art technology and brand new programming languages. Outside of Germany web hosting is taken very loose, you are usually friendly with customers and let them move if they have found better deals. And **just** now profits as a German from the good US dollar, AU dollar to Euro rate.

Germany’s web hosts will also learn it, but it’s well known that everything takes a bit longer here.
