<Blockquote author="Matthew Walker" source="Why We Sleep" sourceUrl="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0141983760?ie=UTF8&tag=stefanimhoffde-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1638&creative=6742&creativeASIN=0141983760">

I was once fond of saying: <q>Sleep is the third pillar of good health, alongside diet and exercise.</q> I have changed my tune. Sleep is more than a pillar; it is the foundation on which the other two health bastions sit. Take away the bedrock of sleep, or weaken it just a little, and careful eating or physical exercise become less than effective.

<Blockquote author="David Katz">

You want to eat fish? Eat fish. You want to eat seafood? Eat seafood. You want to eat some lean meat? Do. You want to eat eggs? Do. You want to eat dairy? Do. But the bulk of your diet should be vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, lentils, nuts, and seeds. This is true all around the world where people do the best.

 You should always let people underestimate you. Because when people misappraise your intelligence and abilities, they’re merely pointing out their own vulnerabilities–the gaping holes in their judgment that need to stay open if you want to cartwheel through later on a flaming horse, correcting the record with your sword of justice.
