## Some Stuff I Carry Around Every Day

A few days ago _Ryan Holiday_ posted the article ‚Äú[Here‚Äôs Some Stuff Worth Carrying With You Everywhere](https://ryanholiday.net/heres-some-stuff-worth-carrying-with-you-everywhere/)‚Äù with an accompanying [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaXMijw241c) on his blog.

Ever since I read the article ‚Äú[Meet the men obsessed with carrying all the right stuff](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/7/24/20696487/everyday-carry-reddit-knife-wallet-gun)‚Äù on Vox, I had the plan to write a similar article, but never had the time to do it.

But due to Coronavirus, there isn‚Äôt much else to do, so I finally shot a photo of my **Everyday Carries**.

## Apple iPhone

In my left pocket, I carry my [iPhone 11](https://www.apple.com/iphone-11/), 64 GB in black. It‚Äôs super fast and the best phone I ever had. I also didn‚Äôt pay one cent for it thanks to my employer. I use a transparent [Torras Crystal Clear iPhone Case](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07VW6QM33?ie=UTF8&tag=stefanimhoffde-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1638&creative=6742&creativeASIN=B07VW6QM33?ie=UTF8&tag=stefanimhoffde-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1638&creative=6742&creativeASIN=http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07VW6QM33?ie=UTF8&tag=stefanimhoffde-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1638&creative=6742&creativeASIN=B07VW6QM33) to protect it.

When I‚Äôm at home I usually put my iPhone into a drawer, to not be constantly distracted by it.

## Amazon Kindle Paperwhite

I always carry my [Kindle Paperwhite](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00QJDU3KY?ie=UTF8&tag=stefanimhoffde-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1638&creative=6742&creativeASIN=B00QJDU3KY) (_7. Generation_) with me. It‚Äôs either in my backpack or in the pocket of my jacket. Whenever I have a few minutes of spare time I read some of [my books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/28460819-stefan?shelf=currently-reading).

I also bought an accompanying [leather cover in Ink blue](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B008BQH1NO?ie=UTF8&tag=stefanimhoffde-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1638&creative=6742&creativeASIN=B008BQH1NO). It‚Äôs soft and nice to hold. Closing the magnetic cover will shut off the Kindle.

## Apple Watch

On my left arm I wear an [Apple Watch](https://www.apple.com/watch/) (_Series 0_ ü§ò). _Not_ waterproof, _no_ always-on display, most apps _don‚Äôt run_ any more, but the battery **still** holds a whole day, including a 40-minute training session.

And the best thing: I didn‚Äôt pay for it, I won it in a prototyping competition from my employer. But I think I might replace the Apple Watch this year with a new model because I miss my Apps like [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) on my watch.

## Apple AirPods Pro

Since December 2019 I always carry my [AirPods Pro](https://www.apple.com/airpods/) with me, either in my left pocket or in my jacket. I‚Äôm pleased with them, as they shield of all the noise while riding on trains or planes.

## Traveler‚Äôs Notebook

In my jacket, back pocket, or bag I always carry a [Traveler‚Äôs Notebook Passport Size](https://www.travelers-company.com/products/trnote/starter-kit-passport) in _Camel_. Usually, I have [2-3 paper notebooks](https://www.travelers-company.com/products/trnote/refill-passport) in it. I also have a [Traveler‚Äôs Notebook Regular Size ](https://www.travelers-company.com/products/trnote/starter-kit-regular), but usually don‚Äôt carry it with me around.

I bought my notebook at [Property Of‚Ä¶](https://thepropertyof.com/) and the leather embossing of my initials was included.

My favorite pen is the [MUJI Gel Ink Ballpoint Pen 0.38mm](https://www.muji.eu/pages/online.asp?Sec=13&Sub=52&PID=11044) with _black ink_. It‚Äôs not smudge-proof and I have other pens for Sketchnotes, but the writing experience of this one is just too good.

## Laguiole en Aubrac Pocket Knife

I bought my [Laguiole en Aubrac](http://www.laguiole-en-aubrac.fr/) pocket knife a few years ago and it is always in my right pocket. It‚Äôs a traditional french knife handmade by artists from Aubrac. Every knife is a unique piece and the artist carves a special pattern on the back of the knife. It‚Äôs available in all price ranges. The handle of my knife is made from juniper wood.

I always carry one, because [Every Man Should Carry a Pocket Knife](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/every-man-should-carry-a-pocket-knife/).

## Secrid Miniwallet

For 6 or 7 years I own a [Secrid Miniwallet](https://secrid.com/wallets/miniwallet), carried in my right pocket. It‚Äôs now so old, I can‚Äôt even tell the original color, but probably some grey. A co-worker showed this Dutch brand to me and I was instantly amazed. I always loved small wallets, but this one is the best.

It is made from leather covering an Aluminium case, preventing unwanted **RFID** and **NFC** communication or bending and breaking of the cards. It has a supercool mechanism to release the cards. It can hold **4-6 cards** in the case and another 4 cards inside. The plastic clip can hold banknotes.

## Keys and Steel Chain

I have all my keys attached to a 75 cm (30 inch) long steel chain, that is attached to my belt loop. I do this for 25 years and I never lost a key.

I like to spin and rotate my keys for fun, it‚Äôs also good martial arts practice. The chain is a fantastic (legal) Ninja weapon ‚Äì [Kusari-fundo, (ÈéñÂàÜÈäÖ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kusari-fundo). You can also just drop your keys when you carry heavy shopping bags and still don‚Äôt lose them.

I try to limit my keys to the absolute minimum amount: House door, flat door, company door, letterbox, and roll container. I also have a [Transcent 64 GB USB 3.0](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B016QAH2N0?ie=UTF8&tag=stefanimhoffde-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1638&creative=6742&creativeASIN=B016QAH2N0) stick attached to the key ring.

## Handkerchief and Glasses Cleaning Cloth

In one of my back pockets, I carry a handkerchief, in the other one a glasses cleaning cloth. I have quite a lot of handkerchiefs since I stopped using paper handkerchiefs (except I‚Äôm sick of course). It‚Äôs much more environmentally friendly to not throw away a handkerchief after using it a few times but to just wash it and take another one.

The glasses cleaning cloth I use ‚Äì you guessed it ‚Äì to clean my glasses, but also to clean iPhone, iPad, and Notebook displays.

That‚Äôs it, feel free to share your **Everyday Carries** in a blog post or photo: Hashtag [\#edc](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/edc/) and [#everydaycarry](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/everydaycarry/). I‚Äôm curious what other people carry around.
