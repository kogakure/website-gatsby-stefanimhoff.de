## Things I Enjoyed in August 2019

I’m trying out a new format: A _monthly_ blog post, including all links, articles, videos, books, products, or other things I liked in the month.

<Blockquote author="Seneca" source="Letters from a Stoic, Letter VI">

If wisdom were offered me on the one condition that I should keep it shut away and not divulge it to anyone, I should reject it. There is no enjoying the possession of anything valuable unless one has someone to share it with.

## TV Shows

- [Mad Men](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/1104-mad-men) <NetflixFlag id="70136135" /> – I started rewatching this fantastic TV show. It won 5 Golden Globes and 132 other awards. Its story spans over multiple years and is so deep and stacked with so many layers of interpretation.
- [Mindhunter](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/67744-mindhunter) <Flag label="2" /> <NetflixFlag id="80114855" /> – I started watching the second season of this Netflix TV show about the FBI unit that started interviewing serial killers in the 1970s to understand and solve these crimes.

## Movies

- [Annihilation](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/300668-annihilation) <NetflixFlag id="80206300" /> – I rewatched the Netflix movie because after reading Lovecraft’s _The Colour out of Space_, I realized that the writers have written in parts—without intention—a nice adaptation of the story.
- [Thor: Ragnarok](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/284053-thor-ragnarok) <NetflixFlag id="80186608" /> – A lot of super-heroes movies are bad these days … but this one was fun.
- [Dunkirk](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/374720-dunkirk) <NetflixFlag id="80170278" /> – A very silent movie about the evacuation of 400,000 soldiers from Dunkirk in May 1940.
- [Baby Driver](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/339403-baby-driver) <NetflixFlag id="80142090" /> – After seeing the video essay of _Like Stories of Old_ about [Introversion in Baby Driver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Zr_4z00hrw), I decided to watch this movie, I had never heard about before. A nice movie!
- [Dave Chappelle: Sticks & Stones](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/624932-dave-chappelle-sticks-stones) <NetflixFlag id="81140577" /> – Very funny, political incorrect, and right to the heart of every virtue signaller and social justice warrior.

## Music

- [The Arrow of Time Soundtrack](https://open.spotify.com/album/2ipnQkuUk9J8tUfuXxzutK) – Music from _Time-lapse of the Future_. Especially [Sun Mother](https://open.spotify.com/track/2zfZ27Aukg5hUlhsd0gOnC) I hear quite often.
- [Deichkind: Keine Party](https://open.spotify.com/album/6jVmvHcCU4RpUI8Gsfhw7X) – I enjoyed the new song from the Hamburg Hip-Hop Band Deichkind. The [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vH1poPSIvOk) is really funny. This dance move will prevail.

## Books

- [The Complete Fiction of H. P. Lovecraft](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44065867-the-complete-fiction-of-h-p-lovecraft) (<AffiliateLink asin="B07NWN6KD6">Amazon</AffiliateLink>) – I’m currently halfway through this book and love Lovecraft Horror.

## Articles

- [IndieWeb Link Sharing](https://mxb.dev/blog/indieweb-link-sharing/) (Max Böck) – How to use a bookmarklet and Lambda functions to post links to your website.
- [I Didn’t Say That](https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/blog-posts/i-didnt-say-that/) (Jordan B Peterson) – An article about deep fakes and their problem, when used for more than fun and art.

## Stuff & Things

- [MUJI Circulator Fan](https://www.muji.com/sg/products/cmdty/detail/4550002435783) – I’ve replaced my 20-year-old fan with this stunning piece of art. It’s so silent you can’t even hear it on the first two levels. It kept me cool this hot month.
