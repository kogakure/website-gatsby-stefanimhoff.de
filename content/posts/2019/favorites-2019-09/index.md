## Things I Enjoyed in September 2019

<Blockquote author="Marcus Aurelius" source="The Meditations, 9.6">

Objective judgment, now, at this very moment. Unselfish action, now, at this very moment. Willing acceptance — now, at this very moment — of all external events.

</Blockquote>

## Quotes

_Jordan B Peterson_ in an interview with _Dave Rubin_ talking about speech police around the world as a disconcerting trend. He explains that we as a society need to be able to transcend the hardship of life with comedy. Comedians are people who push the edge of what’s acceptable. And if we start to prosecute comedians for jokes it’s a warning that our society goes in a dangerous direction:

<Blockquote author="Jordan B Peterson" source="Comedians, canaries and coalminers, 10:11" sourceUrl="https://youtu.be/SYnCaCQe-sI?t=602">

If the king is such a tyrant that he kills his jester, then you know that the evil king is in charge.

</Blockquote>

_Ernest Hemingway_ writing in a letter to _Dorothy Connable_, as he was warning her about _Charles Fenton_, who spread misinformation about Hemingway’s life:

<Blockquote author="Ernest Hemingway" source="Ernest Hemingway Selected Letters 1917-1961">

The way to make people trustworthy is to trust them.

</Blockquote>

The quote above is immediately followed by, <q>But this man is not a person that works with that system.</q>
