## Quotes

<Blockquote author="Jason Fried & David Heinemeier Hansson" source="It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work">

Jean-Louis Gass√©e, who used to run Apple France, describes this situation as the choice between two tokens. When you deal with people who have trouble, you can either choose to take the token that says ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs no big deal‚Äô or the token that says ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs the end of the world‚Äô. Whichever token you pick, they‚Äôll take the other.

<Blockquote author="Lucius Annaeus Seneca" source="On The Firmness of the Wise Man, XVI (translated by Aubrey Stewart, 1900)">

Someone has made a joke about the baldness of my head, the weakness of my eyes, the thinness of my legs, the shortness of my stature; what insult is there in telling me that which everyone sees?
