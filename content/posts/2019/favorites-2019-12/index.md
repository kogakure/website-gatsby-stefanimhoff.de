## Quotes

<Blockquote author="Jason Fried & David Heinemeier Hansson" source="It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work">

Jean-Louis Gassée, who used to run Apple France, describes this situation as the choice between two tokens. When you deal with people who have trouble, you can either choose to take the token that says ‘It’s no big deal’ or the token that says ‘It’s the end of the world’. Whichever token you pick, they’ll take the other.

<Blockquote author="Lucius Annaeus Seneca" source="On The Firmness of the Wise Man, XVI (translated by Aubrey Stewart, 1900)">

Someone has made a joke about the baldness of my head, the weakness of my eyes, the thinness of my legs, the shortness of my stature; what insult is there in telling me that which everyone sees?

<Blockquote author="Stephen Jay Gould" source="Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History, p.35, W. W. Norton & Company">

Life is a copiously branching bush, continually pruned by the grim reaper of extinction, not a ladder of predictable progress.
