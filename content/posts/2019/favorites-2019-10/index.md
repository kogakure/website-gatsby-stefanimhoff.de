## Quotes

This famous _Tears in rain monologue_, written and performed by _Rutger Hauer_ is considered perhaps the greatest death soliloquy in cinematic history. In this scene _Batty_ rescues his hunter from dying as his last, meaningful act and proves himself to be more human than the humans hunting him:

<Blockquote author="Roy Batty (portrayed by Rutger Hauer)" source="Blade Runner" sourceUrl="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/">

I‚Äôve seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannh√§user Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die.

</Blockquote>

Sadly _Rutger Hauer_ died in 2019, the same year his role _Roy Batty_ died.
