## GitHub Style for Gitweb

The standard theme of Gitweb is really not very appealing and apparently designed only for functionality.

I could not stand it anymore. Therefore, I have created an alternative, which is based on the design of GitHub.

The exact installation instructions are included in the package on GitHub.
