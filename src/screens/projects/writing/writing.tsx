        I have been writing articles on this website since 2007. The topics
        include programming, design, self-improvement, productivity, books and
        films. The collection has been much bigger, but I deleted outdated and
        irrelevant articles. Since 2019 I also write a monthly article with
        recommendations of the past month.

      <Paragraph>
        I started writing Haiku poetry some years ago inspired by the works of
        the Japanese Haiku poet <strong>Matsuo Bash√¥</strong>. I think Haiku are
        a fun, creative way to use limitation and brevity while saying something
        meaningful.
