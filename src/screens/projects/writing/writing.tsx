        I have been writing articles on this website since <strong>2007</strong>
        . The topics include programming, design, self-improvement,
        productivity, books, and films. The collection has been much bigger, but
        I deleted outdated and irrelevant articles. Since <strong>2019</strong>{' '}
        I also write a monthly article with recommendations of the past month.

      <Paragraph>
        I started writing Haiku poetry some years ago inspired by the works of
        the Japanese Haiku poet <strong>Matsuo Bash≈ç</strong>. I think Haiku is
        a fun, creative way to use limitation and brevity while saying something
        meaningful.
